Let's take htmx and rust out for a spin.

This repo is a playgorund for me to try out htmx and rust, trying out this thing called hypermedia driven web application.

Why rust? I love rust and want to write more of it.
Htmx?

## Hypermedia Web Playground with HTMX and Rust

Welcome to my playground for experimenting with htmx and Rust to build a hypermedia-driven web application.

### Why Rust?

I like rust and want to write more of it.

### Why HTMX?

I want to explore building a REACT web app, by removing React and letting backend drive the state change.

### Goals

Have fun.
