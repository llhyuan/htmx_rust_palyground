## Hypermedia Web Playground with HTMX and Rust

Welcome to my playground for experimenting with htmx and Rust to build a hypermedia-driven web application.

### Why Rust?

I like rust and want to write more of it.

### Why HTMX?

I want to explore building a REACT web app, by removing React and letting backend drive the state change.

### Goals

Have fun.
